# Rules Evolution and Testing

## Initial Version
The first version of my rules focused primarily on coding style, scope control,
and repository conventions.

Limitations observed:
- The agent sometimes made assumptions
- Responses were occasionally verbose
- Clarifying questions were not always asked

## Refined Version
Based on testing and research, I introduced:
- Explicit clarification requirements
- Step-by-step reasoning expectations
- Guidance on handling uncertainty
- Stronger constraints on scope and refactoring

## Outcome
The refined rules resulted in more predictable behavior, fewer assumptions,
and cleaner, more focused responses aligned with my workflow.
